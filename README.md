- 👋 Hi, I’m @robbiesantana
- 👀 I’m a videographer 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS / HTML and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to closed caption
- 📫 You can find me on @robbieicaro or my website.

This year I'm completing 100 days of code. This is also a crucial year for me since I'm launching my own business and I'm doing the Santiago Way, where I'll be walking for over 10 days from Burgos to Santiago de Compostela (over 200miles).
