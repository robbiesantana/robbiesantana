Hi, I’m @robbiesantana 

 I’m a videographer

-  I’m currently learning CSS / HTML and JavaScript. When I'm not tackling down Codecademy courses, I might be listening music, or writing screenplays and ranting about theater at my blog at http://robbiesantana.com

I started working as video editor freelancer in 2015 and worked with different enegetic entrepeneurs from South Florida area. 

-  🌁 Now that you're there, take a look to this experimental piece.

2024 is a crucial year for me since I'm launching my own business and I'm doing the Santiago Way, where I'll be walking for 12 days. (over 200 miles).

One of my main focus in video editing is creating accesible media pieces. I include closed captioning and other technologies.

- 📫 You can find me on robbiesantana.com

- 🥁 I'm working on http://curiosidadesdecine.com as a side project.
