ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @robbiesantana - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a videographer 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS / HTML and JS 


This year I'm completing 100 days of code. This is also a crucial year for me since I'm launching my own business and I'm doing the Santiago Way, where I'll be walking for over 10 days from Burgos to Santiago de Compostela (over 200miles).

One of my main focus in video editing is creating accesible media pieces. I include closed captioning and other technologies.

I wanted to create a service that include these technologies. That's why I learned [CSS](http://wikipedia.org/css) and BootStrap
