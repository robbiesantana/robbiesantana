👋 Hi, I’m @robbiesantana 

👀 I’m a videographer who worked for years as content creator for a web platform developed in C# and Sharepoint. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS / HTML and JS. When I'm not tackling down CodeAcademy courses, I might be listening music, or writing screenplays and ranting about theater at my blog ccaptive.com

I started working as video editor freelancer in 2015 and worked with different enegetic entrepeneurs from South Florida area. Vimeo Porfolio will show you some of my most recent works

-  🌁 Now that you're there, take a look to this experimental piece.

This year I'm completing 100 days of code. This is also a crucial year for me since I'm launching my own business and I'm doing the Santiago Way, where I'll be walking for over 10 days from Burgos to Santiago de Compostela (over 200 miles).

One of my main focus in video editing is creating accesible media pieces. I include closed captioning and other technologies.

I wanted to create a service that include these technologies. That's why I learned [CSS](http://wikipedia.org/css) and BootStrap
