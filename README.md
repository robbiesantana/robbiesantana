👋 Hi, I’m @robbiesantana - 👀 I’m a videographer 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS / HTML and JS 

-- 💼 Write screenplays and rant about theater at my blog

- 🌉 Vimeo Porfolio will show you some of my most recent works

-  🌁 Now that you're there, take a look to this experimental piece.

This year I'm completing 100 days of code. This is also a crucial year for me since I'm launching my own business and I'm doing the Santiago Way, where I'll be walking for over 10 days from Burgos to Santiago de Compostela (over 200miles).

One of my main focus in video editing is creating accesible media pieces. I include closed captioning and other technologies.

I wanted to create a service that include these technologies. That's why I learned [CSS](http://wikipedia.org/css) and BootStrap

- 📫 You can find me on @robbieicaro | robbiesantana.com
